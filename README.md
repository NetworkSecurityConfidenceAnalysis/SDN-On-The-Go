# SDN-On-The-Go

A low cost, portable, standalone, SDN test bed to gather test data from a real, configurable, 4 SDN switch, 4 host network with out-of-band controller capable of running OpenDaylight.  

Abstract:

     Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a field of research that promises to change the landscape of traditional network topology and management.  Researchers and early adopters need adequate SDN testing facilities.  Industry is responding with embedded support for SDN in their enterprise grade network hardware, but is cost prohibitive for many research test environments.  An alternative is to use software simulated network topology tools that arguably do not emulate real-world behavior.

     Our solution was to build a low cost, portable, standalone SDN test bed.  Called SDN On-The-Go (OTG), the test bed supports many configurations for pseudo real-world SDN experiments.  OTG is a self-contained test bed that can also be used as a portable teaching device, moved from classroom to classroom or taken home for private research.  It weighs about twenty pounds, costs around a thousand dollars and can be setup as a fully functional SDN testbed in a couple of minutes.
